#Directory Typer (Prototype)

#Description
As of present, this project lets you create a list of a directory tree. Any changes made through the editor will be replicated with the actual files, so all renaming can be done in one place.

#Usage
Just run make run to start editing your current directory!
If you would like to use a different directory, run<br>
-$./dirinfo <directory name><br>
-$./editor<br>
separately

#Unfinished
Due to time constraints, only renaming files is allowed. Renaming directories, deleting, and creating new files and directories is a work in progress. There is also little protection against user error.<br>
Only basic typing functionality works. Input and backspace both work. But things like delete and insertion mode do not. 

#Bugs
-Segfaults when one scrolls too quickly<br>
-Problems with small screen sizes<br>
-Scrolling downwards sometimes causes the cursor to jump into the information buffer. It is necessary to scroll back up in order to scroll properly again.
