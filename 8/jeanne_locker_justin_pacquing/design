Project Mates: Jeanne Locker & Justin Pacquing - Pd.8

Project Proposal: Battleship Bash Bros. (BBB)

Description: A program that enables players on different machines to play each other in a game of Battleship!
Two players join the game, set up their fleet of 5 ship on a 5x5 board, and take turns guessing their opponent's ship's locations.

Technicals of How It'll Work:
- Player 1 will act as the server who creates and intializes the shared memory and semaphore, as well as the handshake 
- Player 2 will act as the client who completes the handshake with Player 1.
- Before the handshake is completed, both users will be prompted to select the coordinates to place their ships.
- Players make their guesses by using fgets to input an int that will be written into the shared memory.
That int will then be read by the opponent.
- As well as reading/writing coordinates to the shared memory, the coordinates must be interpretted by the opponent to see if
their ships have been hit, and will send a message back through the pipe to the attacker (like yelling "HIT" or "MISS" in 
real life Battleship)
- 2 Dimensional Arrays will help both players keep track of their own and their opponents boards by interpretting string 
results sent through the pipe and updating boards accordingly, which will be printed out at the start of each turn.
- Once a user has hit all of their opponent's ships, they are declared winner and the game ends.

Concepts/Ideas Used:
- Shared Memory: How players make/read guesses of ship coordinates.
- Semaphores: Prevents both players from reading/writing to shared memory, helps keep turns organized.
- Piping: Allow's players to send Ship Hit/Missed Messages, which is also key in allowing to create/update boards. 
- Signals: Allow's players to quit midgame.

How Work Is Broken Down:
- Justin: Creating Handshake, Dealing with Semaphores and Shared Memory, Generally Putting Everything Together
- Jeanne: Handling Functions for Prompting Information, Displaying Boards 

Timeline:
- Set up pipes - 1/14
- Organize internal stuff (boards, storing of guesses/locations of ships, etc) - 1/19
- Semaphore-ing - 1/20
- Set up limits for user input - 1/22
- Print your and opponent's boards (to see your ships location/where you've guessed) - 1/25
